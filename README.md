# Fake News Project

The purpose of this projcet is to develop and train two different models, a simple and a more advanced, to tell the difference between reliable news and fake news.

We developed a simple logistic regression model and used a subset of the FakeNewsCorpus dataset from github to train it.
In order to use this subset as a training set we had to clean it first. To do this we used the cleantext.clean() module. Here we visualised some of the observations we noted of the FakeNews dataset.

We then used another smaller subset of the FakeNews dataset and used it to test our simple model. To compare our model with a more generel dataset we used a LIAR dataset by William Yang Wang. 
The more advanced model we developed was a Neural Network model. Here we followed the same steps as for the simple model and at last compared the two models. 

Lastly we noted some of the differences between the models and the datasets which might explain the results we obtained.
