# Fake News Project

This project was a part of the coure "Data Science" run by the University of Copenhagen. The objectivbe was to develop and train two different models, a simple and a more advanced, to use the content of an article to predict is reliability.

We developed a simple logistic regression model and used a subset of the FakeNewsCorpus dataset from github to train it.
In order to use this subset as a training set we had to clean it first. To do this we used the cleantext.clean() module. Here we visualised some of the observations we noted of the FakeNews dataset.

We then used another smaller subset of the FakeNews dataset and used it to test our simple model. To compare our model with a more generel dataset we used a LIAR dataset by William Yang Wang. 
The more advanced model we developed was a Neural Network model. Here we followed the same steps as for the simple model and at last compared the two models. 

Lastly we noted some of the differences between the models and the datasets which might explain the results we obtained. 


This project was run on python 3.11.2 was made by Mark Hageman Welin and Oliver Wix Sch√ºtt Wagner.
